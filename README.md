# Film Similarity Analysis

**Description:**  
This project was part of Kavi's recommendation systems research. It analyzes the similarity between films based on gathered metadata and compares its results against a handcrafted similarity dataset. The analysis was performed on a set of 50 films.

---

## Project Overview
The goal of this project was to evaluate how effectively a preliminary recommendation system could determine film similarity. We collected data for 50 films and compared the automatically calculated similarity scores to a manually curated similarity matrix.

The project emphasizes:  
- **Data-driven similarity analysis** for films  
- **Comparative evaluation** between automated and manual similarity scoring  

---

## Features
- **Similarity Computation:** Calculates similarity between films using gathered metadata.  
- **Comparison to Handcrafted Data:** Evaluates how close the automated similarity is to human judgment.  
- **Analysis & Visualization:** Provides insights into which aspects of the recommendation system are accurate and where it fails.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core language for analysis  
- **NumPy & Pandas** – Data processing and handling  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Visualization of similarity comparisons  

---

## Results & Conclusion
- Analyzed 50 films and compared automated similarity to a handcrafted dataset.  
- Insights from this project informed improvements for subsequent, more advanced recommendation system models.  
- Project was eventually superseded by a more effective recommendation system, but provided useful groundwork and validation metrics.
